# ClassRoom Dashboard

This project is a **ClassRoom Dashboard** designed using **HTML** and **CSS**. 
The page is intended to represent a teacher's dashboard, where they can manage classes, materials, groups, 
and track semester progress. It's a simple, non-responsive page tailored for PC format only.

## 📝 Features
- **Sidebar Navigation**: A sidebar containing various sections like Dashboard, Incoming Lessons, Groups, Materials, Semester progress, and Inbox.
- **Add New**: Button to add new lessons, groups, or materials.
- **Icons for easy navigation**: Various icons that help in navigating between sections like Dashboard, Incoming Lesson, and Inbox.

- **Dashboard Overview**:
- **Incoming Lesson Section**: Displays upcoming lessons with time and the batch they belong to.
It also includes the lesson mode (e.g., Online Class: Zoom).
- **Materials Section**: Displays materials available to the class, such as resources for Web Development, SEO, and Design.
- **Groups Section**: Displays groups or batches with their respective student counts,
and allows actions such as sending messages, rescheduling lessons, and sharing materials.
- **Semester Progress**: A progress bar that shows the lesson completion status and upcoming semester exam date.
  
- **Inbox Section**: Displays messages from students with their status (Online/Offline) and their program details.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Used for structuring the content on the page.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling the layout and design.
- **Font Awesome**: Icons used throughout the interface for better usability.

## 📝 Future Improvements

- **Responsiveness**: Currently, the page is designed for PC format only.
I will be working on making it fully responsive, so it adjusts according to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, etc.).
- **JavaScript Integration**: Add interactivity like real-time data updates, and actions such as sending messages or rescheduling lessons.
- **Backend Integration**: Integrate with a backend system (e.g., Node.js) to handle user authentication, real-time data, and class management.
